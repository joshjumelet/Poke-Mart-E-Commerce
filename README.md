The motivation for this project was to refine my programming acumen; continue building and developing my knowledge around React.js as well as broadening my understanding of Postgres Sequelize databases and their interactions with a front end server. I build this project as my capstone project while enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program.
